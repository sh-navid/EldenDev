      "title": "What is State Manager?",
      "description": "A state manager in React is a crucial utility designed to handle and distribute application-wide data. It helps to store and update the application's state, making it accessible to various components without the need for prop drilling. This centralized state management approach simplifies data flow, enhances component reusability, and enhances maintainability, especially in complex applications. State managers allow developers to efficiently manage and synchronize data updates, improving the responsiveness and reliability of React applications. The main goals are to make data accessible to multiple components, centralize state logic, manage state updates, separate state from components, and improve performance and maintainability.",
